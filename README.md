# Wine Quality Classification

## Overview

This project predicts wine quality using logistic regression. The model is trained on various physicochemical features of wine to classify its quality (Good or Bad).

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

## Project Structure

1. **Import Libraries**: Essential libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset and visualize features.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Build and train the logistic regression model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: X%
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides detailed model performance metrics.

## Conclusion

This project uses logistic regression to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties. The model's performance is evaluated through accuracy and a confusion matrix.
